## Installation

You can install the released version of rpvetc from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rpvetc")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gglee4ai/rpvetc")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rpvetc)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# foofactors

Factors are a very useful type of variable in R, but they can also be very aggravating. This package provides some helper functions for the care and feeding of factors.

## Installation

You can install foofactors like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jennybc/foofactors")
```
  
## Quick demo

Binding two factors via `fbind()`:

```{r}
library(rpvetc)
E900_15("P", 0.2, 0.18, 1.36, 0.012, 290, 2.56894e18)  # should be 31.743721
```

Simply catenating two factors leads to a result that most don't expect.

```{r}
```

The `fbind()` function glues two factors together and returns factor.

```{r}

```

Often we want a table of frequencies for the levels of a factor. The base `table()` function returns an object of class `table`, which can be inconvenient for downstream work.

```{r}

```

The `fcount()` function returns a frequency table as a tibble with a column of factor levels and another of frequencies:

```{r}

```
