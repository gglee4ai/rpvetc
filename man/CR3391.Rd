\usage{
CR3391(
  product_form = NULL,
  Cu = NULL,
  Ni = NULL,
  fluence = NULL,
  output = c("TTS", "CF", "FF", "SD"),
  temperature_unit = c("Celsius", "Fahrenheit")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{product_form}{character vector, specifying the product form. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"B"} - Base metal
\item \code{"F"} - Forgings (treated as \code{"B"})
\item \code{"P"} - Plate (treated as \code{"B"})
\item \code{"W"} - Weld metal
}}

\item{Cu}{numeric vector, copper content in weight percent (wt\%). Must be between 0 and 100.}

\item{Ni}{numeric vector, nickel content in weight percent (wt\%). Must be between 0 and 100.}

\item{fluence}{numeric vector, neutron fluence in n/cmÂ². Must be non-negative.}

\item{output}{character, specifying which property to compute. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"TTS"} - Temperature Transition Shift
\item \code{"CF"} - Chemistry Factor
\item \code{"FF"} - Fluence Factor
\item \code{"SD"} - Standard Deviation of the TTS estimation
}}

\item{temperature_unit}{character, specifying the output temperature unit. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Celsius"} - Returns the result in degrees Celsius.
\item \code{"Fahrenheit"} - Returns the result in degrees Fahrenheit.
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the computed result based on the selected \code{output} parameter.
The unit depends on \code{temperature_unit}, except for Fluence Factor (\code{"FF"}), which is unitless.
}
\description{
Computes Temperature Transition Shift (TTS), Chemistry Factor (CF), Fluence Factor (FF), or Standard Deviation (SD)
based on Guthrie's embrittlement model described in NUREG/CR-3391 (1983).
}
\details{
This function provides calculations for base and weld metals using different empirical formulas
depending on material properties such as copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) content, and neutron fluence.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Compute TTS for a base metal
CR3391(product_form = "B", Cu = 0.1, Ni = 0.6, fluence = 1e19, output = "TTS")

# Example 2: Compute CF (Chemistry Factor)
CR3391(product_form = "W", Cu = 0.2, Ni = 0.5, output = "CF")

# Example 3: Compute FF (Fluence Factor) with only fluence
CR3391(fluence = 1e19, output = "FF")

# Example 4: Compute SD (Standard Deviation) for base metal
CR3391(product_form = "B", output = "SD")
