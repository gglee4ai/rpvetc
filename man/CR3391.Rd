\title{Guthrie's Model (NUREG/CR-3391) for Transition Temperature Shift (TTS) Calculation}
\usage{
CR3391(
  product_form = NULL,
  Cu = NULL,
  Ni = NULL,
  fluence = NULL,
  output = c("TTS", "CF", "FF", "SD"),
  temperature_unit = c("Celsius", "Fahrenheit")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{product_form}{Character vector, one of \code{"B"}, \code{"F"}, \code{"P"}, or \code{"W"}.
\code{"F"} (forgings) and \code{"P"} (plates) are treated as base metal (\code{"B"}).}

\item{Cu}{Numeric vector, copper content in weight percent (wt\%). Must be between 0 and 100.}

\item{Ni}{Numeric vector, nickel content in weight percent (wt\%). Must be between 0 and 100.}

\item{fluence}{Numeric vector, neutron fluence in n/cm².}

\item{output}{Character, one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"TTS"} – Transition Temperature Shift
\item \code{"CF"} – Chemistry Factor
\item \code{"FF"} – Fluence Factor
\item \code{"SD"} – Standard Deviation
\item \code{"Margin"} – Regulatory Margin
}}

\item{temperature_unit}{Character, one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"Celsius"} Return results in degrees Celsius
\item \code{"Fahrenheit"} Return results in degrees Fahrenheit
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of computed values for the selected \code{output}. For TTS, CF, and SD,
the unit depends on \code{temperature_unit}. FF is unitless.
}
\description{
Computes the Transition Temperature Shift (TTS), Chemistry Factor (CF),
Fluence Factor (FF), or Standard Deviation (SD) based on the embrittlement model
described in NUREG/CR-3391 (1983).
}
\details{
This model estimates radiation-induced embrittlement in reactor pressure vessel materials
based on copper and nickel content and neutron fluence. It distinguishes between base and weld metals.
